# 3. Machine Learning for Classification


## Churn prediction project

The project is about two companies of telecomunications and we will try to predict which costumer is thinking to leave from company, who are going to churn.

The approache tha we gointo to do is the binari classification. That means that the prediction will be only 0 or 1, True or False, in this case: to churn or not to churn. For this we will use Logistic Regression.
